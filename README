Additional Python support for TextMate. 

Includes:
 * additional documentation links 
 * unittest snippets
 * things borrowed and ported from the Ruby bundle

Notes:
 * The "Make [single|double]-triple-quote" snippets work best if you remove the
   "Inside String: Insert..." snippets from the official Python bundle.
